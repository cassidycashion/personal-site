        With my spring lacrosse season canceled and online schooling, I found myself with more free time during quarantine than I had had in years!
        After completing my work, I found myself indulging in my old hobbies that I had almost forgot about, like nail art. In addition, this inspired me to attempt new hobbies such as hairstyling!

         In 8th grade, i used to paint my nails multiple times a week, watch tutorials on end, and challenge myself to do the most complex nail designs. So, when I returned to nail art years later, I was shocked how difficult it was for me and how much concentration it required. Although it is a silly hobby, it relaxes me, is a creative outlet, and most importantly, it reminds me how some tasks (or designs) may be more difficult than others and that they can be facilitated through concentration and precision.

           Although I don't have photographic evidence of my hairstyling experience, during quarantine hair salons were evidently closed. I have always been naturally talented at braiding hair, so I figured I could at least attempt to dye my mom's roots. Sure enough, she ordered hair dye, I tried my best to emulate how I have seen the hairdressers do it, and I have been dying her roots since! My sister even asked me to dye her hair. So although Covid has been a tragic and inconvenient experience for the world, I am grateful that it has opened up my mind to new experiences and tasks that I would not have done otherwise.
