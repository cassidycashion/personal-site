       Personality Quiz
      </h1>
      <p> Here is my first experience working with Javascript! I created a personality quiz to determine which United States region one would function best in according to their personality. Obviously, there are many stereotypes about each region but after doing research I was able to determine accurate generalizations about each region.

        Here is my next project where I focus on ways to become more ecofriendly. I am very passionate about the environment and am very involved in local organizations such as Clean Ocean Action where I am a Junior Beach Captain and apart of the Junior Green Team in my town.
