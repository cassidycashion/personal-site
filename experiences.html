      In November 2019, I went on my school trip to Avila, Spain and had a very unique and eye opening experience. While a portion of the trip was dedicated to sight seeing and learning about Spanish History, the most emphasized part of the trip was the homestay. For an entire week, I stayed with a Spanish family that spoke no English. Although I was terrified at first, the experience of course improved my Spanish speaking tremendously and encouraged me to have a more global mindset, rather than local. I realized how Spanish people, and people of all different cultures and countries, are much more similar than we may think despite our contrasting customes. I embrace foreign cultures, fully appreciate them, and have had significant personal growth by leaving my comfort zone.
